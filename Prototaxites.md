 Looked like tree trunks, 8m tall

400M years ago when most animals were fish, they are the largest fossils from that era

We're not sure if they stood up or lied down

We're not sure why they disappeared, maybe outcompeted by trees or eaten away by invertebrates that used them as homes

It's not a plant because plants were very small at that time, closer to fungi. However a new study hints that prototaxites are belong to an extinct 4th type of eukaryotic life--neither animal, nor plant, nor fungus.[¹]

Analysis of a specimen of *prototaxite tahiti* revealed that the way its tubes connect is inconsistent with that of mushrooms. More importantly, cells from an actual fungus species were found in its tubes, and their molecular composition did not match at all. The prototaxite did not contain chitin, contrary to modern fungi, but used a protein close to lignin.
