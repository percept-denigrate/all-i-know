Heritability is the measure of genetic contribution to phenotypic variance. Given phenotypic variance $V_P$ and genetic variance $V_G$, we have broad-sense heritability $H^2 = \frac{V_G}{V_P}$. Genetic variance can be broken down between additive $V_A$, and non-additive (dominance $V_D$ and epistatic $V_I$). This allows to calculate narrow-sense heritability $h^2 = \frac{V_A}{V_P}$.

One way of measuring it is twin studies.
- MZ-DZ twins: we measure the correlations of a trait among monozygotic twins, who share 100% of their genes, and dizygotic twins, who share 50% of their genes. Narrow-sense heritability is then $h^2=2(r_{MZ​}−r_{DZ​})$.
- MZA: we measure the correlation between monozygotic twins raised in different families, and compare them to correlation in unrelated individuals. Broad-sense heritability is then $H^2 = R_{MZ}$.

Another way is using [[GWAS]].

Twin studies put [[IQ]] heritability between 0.6 and 0.8 in adulthood[^1][^2]. Those estimates are lower in childhood, see [[Wilson effect]].

| Trait       | MZ-DZ twins | GWAS      |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| IQ          | 0.5 - 0.8   | 0.1 - 0.3 |
| Personality | 0.4 - 0.6   | 0.05-0.15 |
| Height      | 0.7 - 0.9   | 0.5 0.7   |

However heritability is typically measured within group. Withing-group heritability does not automatically generalize to between-group heritability, see [[Lewontin's separate soils]].
