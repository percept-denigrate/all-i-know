[[IQ]] has risen over the past century.[^1] Countries where the average IQ is 100 today had an IQ of 75 a century ago.

This highlights the large impact environment has on IQ. The most likely causes are better education, better nutrition, less violence, and changes in measurement. 

But the Flynn effect is not on [[General intelligence]]: *g*-loaded items are less affected by the Flynn effect.[^2] This means that the Flynn effect and cognitive differences between countries have different causes, otherwise they would have similar loadings.

The Flynn effect seems to have stalled in developed countries, with some observed cases of reversal.[^3][^4]
